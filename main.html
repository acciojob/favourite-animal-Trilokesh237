They’re known as the king of the jungle because of their strength, majesty, and social nature. Lions are the only truly social big cats, living in groups called prides, which are typically led by a dominant male. These prides are usually made up of related females, their cubs, and a few males.

Lions are native to sub-Saharan Africa, though there’s also a small population in the Gir Forest of India (Asiatic lions). They mostly hunt in groups, with the females doing most of the hunting. Lions mainly prey on large herbivores like zebras, antelope, and buffalo.

In terms of physical traits, lions have a distinctive mane, which is unique to males. The mane serves as a sign of strength and helps protect their neck during fights. A lion's roar can be heard from up to five miles away, and it’s often used to communicate with other members of the pride.">
